/**
 * Main index.ts module test
 * 
 * Note: This is a placeholder test file for future implementation.
 * Testing the main module is complex due to:
 * 1. It immediately executes when imported
 * 2. It has side effects like starting servers
 * 3. It requires a complex mock setup for all dependencies
 * 
 * Future improvements should include a proper test implementation
 * with appropriate mocks for SDK, HTTP server, and file system.
